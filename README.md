## Hobbies
Life could be hard sometimes.  
Hopefully, there are also many wonderful things in life.  
It's important to find your own passion, and spend time on it.
### Basketball
I’m a baller since I was 12.   
For the past years, I both earned metals and lost games in the court.   
But the most valuable stuff I gained, can’t be seem by eyes.   
I learnt how to face challenges, to break the limit, to accept failure, to fight with fear.   
Most importantly, the brotherhood I built with teammates is priceless
### Dance  
I have been dancing for 5 years since first year of unversity.  
Dancing is a self-expression, I studied about my own body and learnt how to set it free.   
Dancing is also a social activity, people enjoy music and party together.That's how we make friends through dancing.
### Music
Life is better with music.   
I've falling in love with music shortly after I started to dance.   
Music gives me energy and drives my emotions.   
Having good music is now essential to my life.
### Sketching
Sketch has been one of my hobby since I was little.   
Art was one of my favourite subject, apart from P.E. and Math.   
I love to liberate my imagination by pen and paper.   
I always bring my sketchbook and marker with me when I was traveling.
### Camping  
I was a boy scout in elementary school.   
Since that, I’m in love with nature and camping.   
Last summer, I went to Germany and worked in a camp for 2 months.   
Living in a forest gave me the most peaceful and slow-temple time in my life.
### Hiking
Living in a busy city like Hong Kong. We don't usually have days to spend living in nature.   
Hiking can be another option to escape from urban life.   
Hopefully, we have a lot of beautiful hiking trails in Hong Kong.   
It's fun to explore the view you never see.
### Travelling  
My first backpack travel was in 2013. After that, I am in love with travelling by myself.  
Expolore a new city can be frustrated, but it's also a good way to step out of your comfortzone.  
Making new friends, knowing different cultures and life styles around the world.   
Our life can be much more colorful by travelling the world.
